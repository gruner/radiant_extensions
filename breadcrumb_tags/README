BreadcrumbTags
===========
BreadcrumbTags is a pretty lame extension for the [Radiant CMS][1] that monkey patches the default formatting of the core breadcrumb functionality. It was done mostly as a practice in creating an extension.

The latest version is available at from my git repository at <"http://github.com/divineflame/radiant_extensions/tree/">.
